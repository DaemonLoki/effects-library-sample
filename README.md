# Sample app for the EffectsLibrary

This repo is intended as a sample on how to use all of the effects that the [EffectsLibrary](https://github.com/GetStream/effects-library) has to offer.

The EffectsLibrary is an [open-source](https://github.com/GetStream/effects-library) library for iOS that offers pre-built particle, full-screen effects written in SwiftUI.
